## Work process

Because of the layout's simplicity, it was a quite comfortable working process without any major obstacles.

The only thing which gave me a bit of a headache was the positioning of the image on the very right of the page. Cause I really don't like using `position: absolute;` in combination with `background-image`, as it always feels like a hacky solution to me, and the ability of the image to responsively adjust to the viewport while the surrounding elements adapt to it accordingly is lost. Anyway, by using custom properties and the CSS function `clamp()` I was able to make the background image behave in such a way that it became fluidly responsive like an inline image (`<img>`) that grows and shrinks according to the size of the viewport. For this, no media queries were required.

So, I mainly was experimenting with the [`clamp()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp) function. It allowed me to create not only a smoothly responsive background image, but also a perfectly responsive typography... which is propably the initial purpose of that function, but certainly not limited to it.

It really impressed me how awesome this function works and what possibilities it brings. I will definitely look into this technique in more detail and use it again in the future.
